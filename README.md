#Wordpress starter theme generated through [_S](http://underscores.me/)
I felt it was time that I started customizing my own starter theme to help me kickstart my future Wordpress projects.

Make sure to add the Chrome Live Reload Plugin.
Next run `npm install` and then run `gulp`

###Goals for this theme
* Scalable and Modular CSS architecture
* Modular/DRY Templating


###Future additions
* Integrate Twig Templating
